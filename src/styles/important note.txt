in react there is two types of css files

*note body{} and *{} and elements selectors like img{} are global css for all project components
dont use them please

1. global css files (normal css files)
a css file that has extension file-name.css 
this css file applys css cascading to all css classes in all components in project that has the same name.

2. module css file:
a css file with extension file-name.module.css
this css file applys css cascading only to one component in project even they had repeated names.

* important note classes names use camel case naming convention.


why always css module? because it prevents css clash between all components in project.
